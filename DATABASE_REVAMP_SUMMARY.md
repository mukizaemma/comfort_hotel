# Database Revamp Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive database revamp and role-based access control implementation for the Comfort Hotel Laravel application.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Migrations Created
- **Updated Roles Table**: Added `slug` and `description` fields
- **Updated Users Table**: Removed old `role` column, ensured proper `role_id` foreign key
- **Updated Rooms Table**: Added `room_number`, `room_status`, `max_occupancy`, `bed_count`, `bed_type`
- **Updated Bookings Table**: Added payment tracking fields, check-in/out tracking, assigned room
- **Updated Reservations Table**: Added payment tracking and room assignment
- **Updated Galleries Table**: Added support for videos (upload or YouTube link)
- **New Tables Created**:
  - `expense_categories` - For categorizing expenses
  - `expenses` - For recording expenses
  - `payments` - For tracking payments from rooms and restaurant
  - `invoices` - For generating invoices
  - `service_images` - For multiple images per service
  - `hotel_contacts` - For hotel contact information
  - `terms_conditions` - For terms and conditions content
  - `seo_data` - For SEO metadata per page
  - `room_movements` - For tracking guest room movements

### 2. Models Created/Updated
- **New Models**: `ExpenseCategory`, `Expense`, `Payment`, `Invoice`, `ServiceImage`, `HotelContact`, `TermsCondition`, `SeoData`, `RoomMovement`
- **Updated Models**: `User`, `Role`, `Room`, `Booking`, `Reservation`, `Service`, `Gallery`
- Added role helper methods to User model: `isSuperAdmin()`, `isAdmin()`, `isAccountant()`, `isFrontOffice()`

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- **Roles Created**:
  - **Super Admin**: Full access including user management
  - **Admin**: Full access except user management
  - **Accountant**: Access to reservations, bookings, expenses, and sales reports
  - **Front Office**: Access to room management, check-in/out, reservations, and sales reports

- **Middleware Created**:
  - `SuperAdminMiddleware`
  - `AdminMiddleware` (updated)
  - `AccountantMiddleware`
  - `FrontOfficeMiddleware`

### 4. Controllers Created
- **ContentManagementController**: Manages hotel content (contacts, about, terms, SEO, users, services, rooms, facilities, gallery, slideshow)
- **AccountantController**: Manages expenses, sales, invoices, and payment confirmations
- **FrontOfficeController**: Manages rooms display, reservations calendar, in-house list, check-in/out, walk-in guests, room movements

### 5. Authentication & Redirects
- Created `LoginResponse` class for role-based redirects after login
- Updated `FortifyServiceProvider` to handle role-based redirects
- Updated `RouteServiceProvider` with `getDashboardRoute()` method
- Users are automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard:
  - Super Admin/Admin → `/content-management/dashboard`
  - Accountant → `/accountant/dashboard`
  - Front Office → `/front-office/dashboard`

### 6. Routes Created
- Content Management routes (prefix: `/content-management`)
- Accountant routes (prefix: `/accountant`)
- Front Office routes (prefix: `/front-office`)
- All routes protected with appropriate middleware

### 7. Seeders Created
- **RoleSeeder**: Creates the 4 default roles
- **SuperAdminSeeder**: Creates a default super admin user
- **DatabaseSeeder**: Updated to call the new seeders

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
**Warning**: This will drop all existing tables. If you want to keep existing data, run migrations individually:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 2: Seed the Database
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
This will create:
- 4 roles (Super Admin, Admin, Accountant, Front Office)
- 1 super admin user (email: `superadmin@comforthotel.com`, password: `password`)

### Step 3: Assign Roles to Existing Users
If you have existing users, you'll need to assign them roles:
```php
// In tinker or a seeder
$user = User::find(1);
$role = Role::where('slug', 'admin')->first();
$user->role_id = $role->id;
$user->save();
```

## Default Login Credentials
- **Email**: superadmin@comforthotel.com
- **Password**: password

**Important**: Change the password immediately after first login!

   - `resources/views/content-management/`
   - `resources/views/accountant/`
   - `resources/views/front-office/`

2. **Create Sidebars**: Each dashboard should have a sidebar with only relevant menu items based on the role.

3. **Test the System**: 
   - Create test users for each role
   - Test all functionalities
   - Verify role-based access control

4. **Customize**: Adjust the controllers and views according to your specific needs.

## Notes

- All migrations are timestamped to run in the correct order
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing admin routes
- Room status is automatically updated during check-in/check-out operations
- Payment tracking is integrated with bookings and reservations
- The system supports both online and walk-in bookings

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all migrations ran successfully
2. Verify that roles and super admin user were seeded
3. Ensure users have proper role assignments
4. Check middleware registration in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
